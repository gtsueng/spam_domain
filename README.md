### Spam domain list

This repo pulls predatory journals and conferences from Beall's list and Dolo's list and exports it into a format that can be ingested by MS Outlook for junk domain list blocking.

Yes, Beall's list had biases with some Open Access publishers, but not everyone wishes to be on every mailinglist (open access or not) just because they published preprints. Note, Beall's list is no longer maintained, so this repo just uses an archive of it
